All-cause mortality,"A measure of all deaths, due to any cause, that occur during a clinical study."
Allocation,A method used to assign participants to an arm of a clinical study. The types of allocation are randomized allocation and nonrandomized.
Arm,"A group or subgroup of participants in a clinical trial that receives a specific intervention/treatment, or no intervention, according to the trial's protocol."
Arm type,"A general description of the clinical trial arm. It identifies the role of the intervention that participants receive. Types of arms include experimental arm, active comparator arm, placebo comparator arm, sham comparator arm, and no intervention arm."
Baseline characteristics,"Data collected at the beginning of a clinical study for all participants and for each arm or comparison group. These data include demographics, such as age, sex/gender, race and ethnicity, and study-specific measures (for example, systolic blood pressure, prior antidepressant treatment)."
Canceled submission,"Indicates that the study sponsor or investigator recalled a submission of study results before quality control (QC) review took place. If the submission was canceled on or after May 8, 2018, the date is shown. After submission of study results, a study record cannot be modified until QC review is completed, unless the submission is canceled."
Certain agreements,"Information required by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. In general, this is a description of any agreement between the sponsor of a clinical study and the principal investigator (PI) that does not allow the PI to discuss the results of the study or publish the study results in a scientific or academic journal after the study is completed."
Certification,"A sponsor or investigator may submit a certification to delay submission of results information if they are applying for FDA approval of a new drug or device, or new use of an already approved drug or device. A sponsor or investigator who submits a certification can delay results submission up to 2 years after the certification/extension first submitted date, unless certain events occur sooner. See Delay Results Type in the Results Data Element definitions for more information about this certification."
Certification/extension first posted,The date on which information about a certification to delay submission of results or an extension request was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov. ClinicalTrials.gov does not indicate whether the submission was a certification or extension request. There is typically a delay between the date the study sponsor or investigator submitted the certification or extension request and the first posted date.
Certification/extension first submitted,"The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a certification or an extension request to delay submission of results. A sponsor or investigator who submits a certification can delay results submission up to 2 years after this date, unless certain events occur sooner. There is typically a delay between the date the certification or extension request was submitted and the date the information is first available on ClinicalTrials.gov (certification/extension first posted)."
Certification/extension first submitted that met QC criteria,The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a certification or an extension request that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. The sponsor or investigator may need to revise and submit a certification or extension request one or more times before NLM's QC review criteria are met. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. Meeting QC criteria for an extension request does not mean that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has determined that the request demonstrates good cause. The process for review and granting of extension requests by the NIH is being developed.

Cross-over assignment,"A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which groups of participants receive two or more interventions in a specific order. For example, two-by-two cross-over assignment involves two groups of participants. One group receives drug A during the initial phase of the trial, followed by drug B during a later phase. The other group receives drug B during the initial phase, followed by drug A. So during the trial, participants ""cross over"" to the other drug. All participants receive drug A and drug B at some point during the trial but in a different order, depending on the group to which they are assigned."
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC),"A group of independent scientists who monitor the safety and scientific integrity of a clinical trial. The DMC can recommend to the sponsor that the trial be stopped if it is not effective, is harming participants, or is unlikely to serve its scientific purpose. Members are chosen based on the scientific skills and knowledge needed to monitor the particular trial. Also called a data safety and monitoring board, or DSMB."
Early Phase 1 (formerly listed as Phase 0),"A phase of research used to describe exploratory trials conducted before traditional phase 1 trials to investigate how or whether a drug affects the body. They involve very limited human exposure to the drug and have no therapeutic or diagnostic goals (for example, screening studies, microdose studies)."
Eligibility criteria,"The key requirements that people who want to participate in a clinical study must meet or the characteristics they must have. Eligibility criteria consist of both inclusion criteria (which are required for a person to participate in the study) and exclusion criteria (which prevent a person from participating). Types of eligibility criteria include whether a study  accepts healthy volunteers, has age or age group requirements, or is limited by sex."

There are three types of expanded access: Individual Patients: Allows a single patient, with a serious disease or condition who cannot participate in a clinical trial, access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This category also includes access in an emergency situation.Intermediate-size Population: Allows more than one patient (but generally fewer patients than through a Treatment IND/Protocol) access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA.  This type of expanded access is used when multiple patients with the same disease or condition seek access to a specific drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA.Treatment IND/Protocol: Allows a large, widespread population access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This type of expanded access can only be provided if the product is already being developed for marketing for the same use as the expanded access use."
Experimental arm,An arm type in which a group of participants receives the intervention/treatment that is the focus of the clinical trial.
Extension request,"In certain circumstances, a sponsor or investigator may request an extension to delay the standard results submission deadline (generally one year after the primary completion date). The request for an extension must demonstrate good cause (for example, the need to preserve the scientific integrity of an ongoing masked trial). All requests must be reviewed and granted by the National Institutes of Health. This process for review and granting of extension requests is being developed. See Delay Results Type in the Results Data Element definitions for more information."
Factorial assignment,"A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which groups of participants receive one of several combinations of interventions. For example, two-by-two factorial assignment involves four groups of participants. Each group receives one of the following pairs of interventions: (1) drug A and drug B, (2) drug A and a placebo, (3) a placebo and drug B, or (4) a placebo and a placebo. So during the trial, all possible combinations of the two drugs (A and B) and the placebos are given to different groups of participants."

A Notice of Noncompliance indicates that the FDA has determined the responsible party was not in compliance with the registration or results reporting requirements for the clinical trial under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, Section 801 (FDAAA 801).The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is required by FDAAA 801 to add information to a study record about any FDAAA 801 Violation. This information is provided by the FDA. There are three categories of information that may be included:Violation: Shown when the FDA issues a Notice of Noncompliance and posts the Notice of Noncompliance on its designated webpage. There are three types of violations:Failure to submit required clinical trial informationSubmission of false or misleading clinical trial informationFailure to submit primary and secondary outcomesCorrection: Shown when the FDA confirms that the responsible party has updated the study record to correct the violation and posts the correction notice on its designated webpage.  Because of the time for FDA review and processing, there may be a delay between the date when the study record was updated and the addition of correction information to the FDAAA 801 Violation information. Penalty: Shown when the FDA imposes a penalty for the violation and posts the penalty notice on its designated webpage."
